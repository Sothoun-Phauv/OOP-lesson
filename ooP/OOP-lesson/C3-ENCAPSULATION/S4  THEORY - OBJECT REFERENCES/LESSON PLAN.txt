- equal by value (value object)
		"A value object is an object that represents an entity whose equality is not based on identity (id)"

		- 2 points are equals if ?
		- 2 rectangles are equal if ?
		- A date

		- A date range

		- A money value with currency
		- A measure with unit	
 

		- An adress

	==> those objects should be immutable : if you change it, you duplicate it !
		

		- 	translate a point, convert a mesure into another unit,   change a date
 		- 	clone the value object

- equal by ID
		- mail
		- student
		- order

	==> those objects are not immutable : they can be changed
